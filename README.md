# LED Pseudo Monochromator Firmware

Firmware for an Monochromator that is using a bank of LEDs which
have their emission peak at different locations in the spectrum.

A TLC5947 PWM controller is used for LED IO.

Controlling the LEDs (on, off, brightness) is done via a simple
ASCII based serial interface.
